There is still room for improvement. This figure shows how a product receives its **Quality Approval** only when its blockchain record shows it has a production date, safety inspection, and was shipped at the correct temperature. Sensors in the shipping container report temperature data every 5 minutes and consolidate it into a daily report.

With the knowledge you have acquired, think about how to take advantage of blockchain technology applying the NEM development process.

Then, read [this thread](https://forum.nem.io/t/how-you-can-setup-a-basic-iot-tracking-solution-for-a-local-meat-farm-using-arduino-and-nem-iot-blockchain/17809) where the community is discussing how to solve precisely this second part of the use case. Discuss your solution with others; it can help you improve your own solution before you start implementing it.

Finally, we encourage you to develop the solution you come up with.  You could opt to do it on top of the current app, or create a whole new project. 

Find in the [NEM Developer Center](https://nemtech.github.io/) more information about the built-in features, tools references and step-by-step guides.
